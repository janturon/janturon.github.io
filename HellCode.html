<h1>HellCode manifesto</h1>

<p>There are many coders who brag with "tiny" or "lightweight" code with tens of kilobytes JS minified and gzipped. In real, <b>EVERY</b> (100%, without a single exception) minified and gzipped code is bloated and ineffective. Reasons:</p>

<ol>
 <li>gzip compress ratio for text is some 10%, so the actual code has hundreds of kilobytes - what a shame.
 <li>gzipping is cheating: JS interprets can't process gzipped code, they need to unzip it before running.
 <li>The internet browsing bottleneck moves from network traffic towards battery time, so focus should be moved from code size to code efficiency. Gzipping conceals the inefficiency in small size.
</ol>

<p>Intermediate coders code simple ideas in complex code (they create libraries and frameworks for intermediate coders).<br>
Advanced coders code complex ideas in simple code (they don't need libraries, they pick the right language).<br>

<p>If you want to code a library, you should do it in lower-level language. Same-level language increases the commands executed polynomically: every command translated into several library commands and every library command translates into several engine commands. In scripting language one should express only highly abstract simple ideas. To prove it, I challenge you to code it under <a href="LICENSE.md">HELL license</a>. This means your code will be 666 bytes long, without minification, without gzipping, without external libraries and indented.
 
<p>Why to do this? Parkinson's law implies that any code that is not obvious on the first spot is doomed. Only the simplest ideas survive and the 666 bytes limit forces you not to add any expendable parts: anybody can learn 666 bytes code to the last bit in short time. It won't grow. If you absolutely need to add something, you also absolutely need to remove something else, or the complexity rises and the unavoidable end is coming.

<p>All of our ideas are simple and they are connected in a simple way to other ideas. "Complex code" is nothing but merging the connections into the idea, not knowing its <i>essence</i>.
