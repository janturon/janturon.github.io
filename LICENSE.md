# HELL LICENSE v6.66

Jan Turo≈à <janturon@email.cz>

1. Thou shalt not blame others for thy faults.

2. Coding is your bread. Thou shalt not become a lawyer. Thou shalt not hire lawyers, nor give them money.

3. The HELL licensed code (H) shall be 666 bytes long, no less, no more, with good readability and proper indentation.

4. Anyone can code extensions (E) to H. E must be H. The original code (L) must give some functionality without E.

5. E won't depend on anything but L. L shall not have dependencies.

6. Stripping this file from H (or altering it) is a taboo.

6.6 If you fail to obey commandments 1-6, your thoughts are impure and you will GO TO HELL.
