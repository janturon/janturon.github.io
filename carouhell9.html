<h1>Carouhell - manual rotation</h1>
<p><a href="carouhell.html">Back to Carouhell</a></p>

<p>Carouhell provides <b>data-load</b> attribute, which can contain any valid JS code that executes after the carouhell and all its extensions (if any) loads. If you don't provide the attribute, it defaults to <code>this.play()</code>, which autoplays the carouhell.</p>
<p>Basic carouhell also provides the <code>left()</code> method which rotates one frame from right to left. Both methods can be called outside of carouhell scope (without using <i>this</i> on carouhell's attributes), see the buttons below.</p>
<p>Alas, there is no pause method, but the timer is exposed in <code>t</code> attribute, which you can clear by yourself, see the <b>onmouseover</b>, which pauses autoplay rotation on mouse hovering above the carousel (similarly, you could also attach the timer clearing to touch event or use general pointer events).</p>
<p>To change the rotation speed, set the <b>data-stay</b> attribute, then pause, then play again. This is non-intuitive, but I reached my limits what can I stuff into the 666 bytes long code. If you need more comfortable way to handle your carouhell, use <b>the buttons extension</b>, which adds more features in another 666 bytes, pause method and play method reacting on attribute changes among them.</p>
