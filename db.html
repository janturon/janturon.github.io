<h2>The history and current state of WebSQL</h2>
<p>Mozzila convinced in 2010 the W3C not to develop the standard as the only implementation was SQLite. As a consequence, Firefox intentionally didn't include the support and later Safari <a href="https://caniuse.com/sql-storage">abandoned</a> theirs. Luckily, WebKit maintains it for more than a decade since then, and other vendors seem to follow them as implementing SQLite is relatively easy and very useful. Let's hope the public pressure will revive the W3C standard.

<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>WebSQL is implemented with asynchronous interface, which DB simplifies by utilizing Promises: modern approach to parallel programming in Javascript. The simplicity comes at cost of transactions, which can be easily understood from the source code.
